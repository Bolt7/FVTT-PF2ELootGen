# FVTT PF2E Loot Generator
A loot generator/utility for the PF2E system in Foundry VTT. May eventually become system agnostic, but for now it only works with PF2E.

# Features
This module was originally part of *PF2E Toolbox*, however it is now separate for ease of maintainability. Below are its features, new features are in bold.

- **Roll a group of tables using a weighted table distribution**
- Quickly roll a single table and add the item to a loot sheet
- Respects PF2E Toolbox's quicky mystification (holding alt mystifies items).
